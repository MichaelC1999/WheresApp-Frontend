This is the frontend of 'WheresApp', my social media site. This was built in React and is made up of numerous class components. The client was styled in CSS but Bootstrap was used on some components for easier styling.

This application is similar to my 'Feed Social Media' project, as users can create an account and upload posts. However, the data is presented in a different way, and the current functionality has potential for other (soon to come) features such as messaging, indexing by location, and commenting on posts.

Some concepts used in the frontend include Lazy Loading, routing, and Redux to help manage authentication.
