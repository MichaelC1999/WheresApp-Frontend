This is the frontend of 'WheresApp', my social media site. This was built in React and is made up of numerous class components. The client was styled in CSS but Bootstrap was used on some components for easier styling.

The backend was written in Express/Node.js and accepts requests from the React frontend. Users can login and create/edit/delete posts. Users can also make comments on any post. Profile images and post images get uploaded and hosted on Cloudinary. Some concepts used in the frontend include Lazy Loading, routing, and Redux to help manage authentication.
